### What I learned

I learned that I have a lot of work to do as far as JS goes. I have been struggling with this project mainly because of the JSON file. I tried my hardest but in the end, I kept struggling with displaying the image that is contained within the JSON. I know why I struggled and it's because I was using code that just simply wasn't compatible with what my end result should be. I really need to take a few courses and brush up on my JS skills.

In general, I was at least proud of the fact that my CSS and HTML skills are improving. Still a lot of work to do as far as clean code goes.

### Continued development

As mentioned before, I really need to work on my JS skills. I thought I had an understanding that could get me by but there's still a bit to work on.

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
